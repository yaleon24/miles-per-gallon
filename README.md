# miles-per-gallon
Create a program that accepts the miles driven (as a decimal) and the gallons used (as a decimal).  Calculate the miles per gallon and display the result (as a decimal).  Read in the miles and gallons using the Scanner class.  If 0 is entered in for the gallons used, display "Can not calculate."  Do not print out anything requesting the miles or gallons.  For testing, two decimal values will be entered into your program.  Before submitting your file, delete the line with the package information.
